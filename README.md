# Basics of R: Data Analysis and Visualization

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of R programming, focusing on basic data analysis and visualization techniques. It serves as an introduction to the R language, showcasing how to manipulate datasets, perform calculations, and create visualizations in R.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- To introduce basic R syntax and functions.
- To demonstrate data manipulation and cleaning techniques.
- To showcase the use of R for exploratory data analysis and visualizations.
- To highlight the flexibility of R in statistical analysis and graphical representation.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Data Types**: Overview of data types in R (vectors, data frames, lists, etc.).
- **Basic Operations**: Arithmetic operations, logical comparisons, and working with functions in R.
- **Data Manipulation**: Using the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages to filter, group, summarize, and reshape data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Descriptive statistics and data summary using base R and tidyverse functions.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating simple visualizations using the `ggplot2` package.

## Example Functions and Code Snippets

1. **Basic Arithmetic and Data Types**:
   ```r
   # Basic arithmetic in R
   x <- 10
   y <- 5
   z <- x + y
   print(z)

   # Working with vectors
   my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
   print(my_vector)
